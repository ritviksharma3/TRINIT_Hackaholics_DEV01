## 👉 Problem Statement 💭 

### Topic: Drag and drop elements to create a website
Building a website is quite fun but at times it might get
frustrating and take up a lot of time. Instead, an application 
which allows us to build a website just by dragging and 
dropping elements would be much more efficient and user 
friendly than coding each and every part of the website 
(Similar to Wix). Also people with no prior knowledge of web 
development could also build a website.
Develop a solution through which a person can create a 
website just by dragging and dropping elements<br>

 ## Main features ⛳ 
- [ ] The user should be able to add basic components like buttons, 
 cards, nav bar, footer, text-area, images, etc… just by 
 dragging and dropping the component.
- [ ] The user should be able to determine the color, shape, size and 
 position of the added component.
- [ ] The user should be able to determine the font features like font 
 color, font size, font style, text-alignment.
- [ ] Basic animations like hover animations, on click animations, 
 position animations, etc.. should be included.
